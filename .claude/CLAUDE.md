# AI Workbench Workspace

A productivity workspace for Claude Code. Slash commands generate PRDs, research, emails, brainstorms, code reviews, and more. All output lands in `personal/` (gitignored) or the active project folder.

## Commands

## personal/ Folder

All generated content lives here. Gitignored. Subfolders:

- `agendas/` — meeting agendas
- `analysis/` — style guides
- `brainstorms/` — brainstorm sessions
- `docs/` — plans, handover docs
- `drafts/` — PRDs, user stories
- `journal/` — daily entries
- `projects/` — project-scoped workspaces (see `.claude/rules/project-scoping.md`)
- `prompts/`, `research/`, `tasks/` — self-explanatory

## Core Rules

Detailed rules live in `.claude/rules/` so this file stays lean. Load them when relevant:

- **`project-scoping.md`** — how command output routes when a project context is active
- **`file-naming.md`** — `YYYY-MM-DD-DAY.md` for journals, `YYYY-MM-DD_topic_type.md` for everything else
- **`date-verification.md`** — mandatory checklist before writing any dated file (prevents wrong-date and wrong-day-of-week bugs)
- **`task-folders.md`** — `_inbox/`, `work/`, `personal/`, `ideas/`
- **`repo-analysis.md`** — `/repo-*` output layout and ordering
- **`autonomy.md`** — what to do without asking; when to pause

Optional user-configurable files (templates in [`_examples/`](../_examples/)):

- **`personal/tags.md`** — auto-hashtag rules + people/customers/projects for `[[wiki-links]]`. Used by `/meeting-journal`. Without it, only `#meeting` is applied and names stay plain.
- **`personal/organization.md`** — keyword-to-task-folder routing. Used by `/meeting-journal`. Without it, action items default to `tasks/_inbox/`.

## Automation

- **Auto-journaling** runs as a `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`.claude/hooks/auto-journal-detect.sh`). When your prompt reads like day-talk, Claude gets a reminder to append to today's journal — you don't need to run `/daily` explicitly.
- **Scheduled journaling** — `/morning-sync` and `/evening-sync` can be scheduled via Claude Code Desktop to keep the journal current automatically. See [`resources/getting-started/setup-scheduled-journaling.md`](../resources/getting-started/setup-scheduled-journaling.md).
- **Temp files** (`temp-files/`, gitignored) are an *input* staging area for files to process (PowerPoints, transcripts). Never write output there.

## Reference

- `prompt-templates/` — universal prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini
- `guides/` — role-based starting points
- `resources/` — getting-started docs
- `_examples/` — sample file formats
